## What is the task? 
The task has given to us create the same landing page, output img has given to us. Also HTML file has given. We have to write only css for given html file. One Rule is, we can not modify in the html file.

## My Approach

In the navbar section, i have used  `display:flex; ` property to manage the navbar elements.

In the hero section, i put the `background-image`. And other properties also like `background-position, background-repeat, background-size`.

On buttons, i used hover over effects. When you hover over on the buttons then button background-color changes.

I also used some media queries for responsize design.
