## What is the task? 
The task has given to us create the same landing page, output img has given to us. Also HTML file has given. We have to write only css for given html file. One Rule is, we can not modify in the html file.

## My Approach

In this project, the main task is to positioned the lots of images as shown as output image.

So here, i used one of the most important CSS property ` position: absolute;`.

Whenever, you apply position property to any element then you can use four properties also `top, bottom, left and right` for positioning of element. If you used ` position : absolute;` property to any element then, you have to positioned their parent element also. Because `absolute` position element always dependent on their parent element. If their are no positioned parent element then it calculates from `body`.
